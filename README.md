This app aims to bridge the gap between efficient development and StreamElements. Create an overlay, add a widget, and start coding right in your preferred editor.

# Installation and launching

1. Run this command in the terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Redo7/se-dev-env
cd se-dev-env
npm install
```
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with these values:
  -   `VITE_GOOGLE_FONTS_API_KEY = your-api-key-here`
3. To run the app, choose one of the options below
  - Terminal: `npm run dev`
  - VSCode: Run `code .` in the terminal to open the app's folder in the editor. Then just run `npm run dev` in its integrated terminal
    - Not a lot of difference, but at least you can close the other terminal window
4. Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

# Configuration

1. You can add your own widget templates and create them on any overlay by simply putting your `html.html`, `css.css`, `js.js`, `fields.json`, and `data.json` inside of `/templates/user/{your template name}`. The app is going to scan that directory, and will automatically add them to the `+` button on the overlay.
  - Or just import a widget.io compatible widget, edit it's files if needed, and click `Make a template` from the context menu.

> [!NOTE]
> 2. It's recommended you create private repos inside of `/templates/user/` and `/overlays/` and push them to a remote in order to have a backup of your files.

# Using the app

1. Make a new overlay
2. Make or Import a new widget
3. Hover over the widget and click the 3 dots to open the context menu
4. Click `Open in Editor` to open the widgets files in VSCode (for now just VSCode)
